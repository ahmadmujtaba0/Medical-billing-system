Medical Billing Management System

Introduction:
The Billing Management System (BMS) is a software application introduced to automate and streamline the 
billing process for a medical store or pharmacy. This system, implemented in x86 assembly language for the DOS 
operating system, provides a platform for managing the sale of medicines, tracking quantities sold, calculating 
total earnings, and presenting statistics to users.

Problem Statement:
The current manual billing processes in medical stores and pharmacies pose challenges of inefficiency and errors. 
The manual calculations can lead to mistakes, impacting inventory management and causing delays for customers. 
This burdens store personnel, hampers the accuracy of sales transactions, and hinders the overall efficiency of 
operations. There is a clear need for an automated Billing Management System (BMS) to streamline processes, 
reduce errors, and enhance the overall effectiveness of medical retail establishments.

Aim & Objectives: 
The primary aim of the Billing Management System (BMS) project is to revolutionize the medical billing process 
in stores and pharmacies by introducing automation and a user-friendly interface. The objectives include 
implementing an automated system to reduce manual calculations and enhance accuracy, creating an intuitive 
interface for easy navigation by both customers and store staff, ensuring streamlined day-to-day operations with 
minimized complexities and errors, and promoting accessibility for a broad user base. The system aims to 
significantly reduce errors in billing transactions, providing a reliable and precise platform for managing sales. 
Ultimately, the project seeks to improve the overall satisfaction of both customers and store staff by simplifying 
billing procedures and fostering a more user-friendly environment in the medical retail sector.

Use of Tools:
Emulator 8086 is a high demanding emulator for the 8086 architectures, providing a platform to run and test your 
assembly code. DOSBox, while more general-purpose, can also be configured for 8086 emulations. Turbo 
Assembler is a widely used assembler for x86 assembly codes. It helps to translate your assembly code into 
machine code that the emulator processor can execute. Debuggers play an important role in assembly language 
development. Turbo Debugger allows you to go through your code, set breakpoints, and determine the registers 
and memory.

Conclusion:
The Billing Management System presented in this project aims to significantly improve the efficiency of billing 
processes in medical stores. By automating calculations, providing a user-friendly interface, and offering 
statistical insights, the system addresses key challenges faced by traditional manual billing systems.
